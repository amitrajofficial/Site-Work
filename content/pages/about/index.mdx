Hi there! 

I'm a Computer Engineer with over 11 years of experience in the software industry, focused on Android Development. I'm a passionate about software architecture, the open-source world, user experience and user interfaces.

I'm originally from Spain but I'm currently living in US. I do Android apps for living but in my spare time, a part from spending time on continuous learning, I also love running and outdoor activities, cinema and playing board games.
